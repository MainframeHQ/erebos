title: Individual APIs
---

The [`SwarmClient` class](swarm-client.md) provides the following APIs, but they can also be used individually:

- [Bzz APIs](api-bzz.md) for file storage (includes feeds)
- [Pss APIs](api-pss.md): Postal Services over Swarm (UDP-like messaging)

Additionally, the [`Timeline` APIs](timeline-api.md) are exported in a separate package, providing an implementation of the [timeline protocol](timeline-spec.md).
